# Job Planner

## What is Job Planner

A simple Proof of Concept of a job planner application that allows users to
create job search plans with the help of openly available data from Jobtech
and a GTP assistant. Also just an excuse for me to try some new things I've
been waiting to try such as Drizzle, integrating with OpenAIs API's and
Vercel Postgres.

## Will this go further than being just a PoC?

Propably not.. but who knows?
